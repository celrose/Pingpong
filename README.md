# Pingpong
A simple 2 player ping pong game developed with the guidance of this:
http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html

Controls are:
Letters A and D for the first player.
Arrow keys LEFT and RIGHT for the second player.

First player to score three (3) wins the game!


Developer note:
The file main.java was the planned MAIN MENU of the game but I never got to finish it. It's all static. Buttons work but it isn't connected to the finished game.
